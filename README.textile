h1. About

This is an AMQP parser for AMQP 0.9.1. It isn't an AMQP client, just the parser, so if you want to write your own AMQP client without digging into the protocol, this gem can help you with that.

h1. Usage

<pre>
gem install amqp-parser
</pre>

Check the @examples@ directory for some examples.

h1. Development

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/botanicus/amq-protocol.git --recursive
</pre>

Or, if you are on an older version of Git:

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/botanicus/amq-protocol.git
git submodule update --init
</pre>

If you want to change some code, don't do so in @lib/amq/protocol.rb@, but in @protocol.rb.pytemplate@ which is a template file for @codegen.py@. You can re-generate the code by @./tasks.rb generate@.
