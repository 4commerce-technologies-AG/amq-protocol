h1. About amq-protocol.

amq-protocol is an AMQP 0.9.1 serialization library for Ruby. It is not an
AMQP client: amq-protocol only handles serialization and deserialization.
If you want to write your own AMQP client, this gem can help you with that.

h2. How does amq-protocol relate to amqp gem, amq-protocol and libraries like bunny?
