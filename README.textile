h1. About

This is an AMQP parser for AMQP 0.9.1. It isn't an AMQP client, just the parser, so if you want to write your own AMQP client without digging into the protocol, this gem can help you with that.

h1. Usage

<pre>
gem install amq-protocol
</pre>

Check the @examples@ directory for some examples.

h1. Development

h2. Nightly Builds

You can always find nightly builds at "gems.101ideas.cz":http://gems.101ideas.cz. You can install them thusly:

<pre>
wget http://gems.101ideas.cz/amq-protocol-nightly.gem
gem install amq-protocol-nightly.gem
</pre>

_*NOTE:* This could be better achieved by a gem server, but it's just utterly broken._

h2. Git Repository

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-protocol.git --recursive
</pre>

Or, if you are on an older version of Git:

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-protocol.git
git submodule update --init
</pre>

If you want to change some code, don't do so in @lib/amq/protocol/client.rb@, but in @protocol.rb.pytemplate@ which is a template file for @codegen.py@. You can re-generate the code by @./tasks.rb generate@.
